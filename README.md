## Your Name

A sentence about who and what you are. Then a sentence about what you've achieved. And then a sentence about what you're looking for: what you would ideally be doing, with whom and in what environment.

Im a highly motivated individual who has worked in the engineering sector, as well as having a background in chemistry, and am newly graduated from the makers academy coding bootcamp. Programming appeals to my exploratory nature of probing a problem, analysing it using scientific techniques, forming a solution and then implementing it programatically. Ive been involved in system design and improvement,  leveraging an ability in interpreting and analysing technical data (matlab primarily), in conjuction with a deep understanding of modelling systems using complex simulation software (zemax - optical) to bring to bear a deep understanding of the solutions required. I hope to now flip the coin and solve the problems that programming engages with. 

## Skills

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence

important set of skills; namely to multitask and prioritise

Took part in system design and improved use of cadcam software.

improvement of imaging, measurement and calibration techniques through matlab (aberration plots, interpolation heat maps)

highlighting of optical design strategies with zemax (aberration plots, coating modelling)

I have developed a strong ability in debugging and testing propieratory software (in house sotware).

Ive also developed cadcam capabilites (cadcam tooling automation, cadcam drawing, post-processors) and hardware (optical assemblies, control circuits, drive wiring). Writing G code.

Adapting post-processors for sepcific requirements.
