## Joe Pike

Im a highly motivated individual who has worked in the engineering sector, as well as having a background in chemistry, and am newly graduated from the makers academy coding bootcamp. Programming appeals to my exploratory nature of probing a problem, analysing it using scientific techniques, forming a solution and then implementing it programatically. Ive been involved in system design and improvement,  leveraging an ability in interpreting and analysing technical data, in conjuction with an understanding of modelling systems using complex simulation software, to bring a technical analyses to bear. I hope to now flip the coin and join a team engaged in solving problems programatically in a hard working and focussed atmosphere.

## Skills

#### Multitasking and Prioritising

Coming from a background where my finger was in many pies I developed an ability to multi-task and prioritise. From system design to improvement of cadcam software; from improvement of imaging, measurement and calibration techniques to simulating and implementing optical design strategies. Within a small team, being multi-skilled to cover varied technical aspects of the product was paramount, as was prioritising the work to be done.

#### Software debugging and improvement

From debugging propieratory software to considering how the use of cadcam software can be optimised by automating repetitve tasks through simple macros, I've had a hand in improving and making more efficient the way software is used. In addition, I've written g-code programs for cnc controllers and post-processors (cnc 'drivers') for sepcific requirements.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (November 2017 - February 2018)

Interest in code developed as a byproduct of my use of software for a job and my inclination to avoid repetitive tasks, which set the ball rolling for me trying to automate some of these tasks.

Im an independent learner since I begun the process of automating the use of cadcam software as a solo endeavour with no outside help or input.

Im a great collaborator as I always maintain high energy and positivity, an open mind, willingness to learn, and willingness to be wrong. Ask any of my fellow makers graduates.

#### University of Liverpool (September 2009 - July 2013)

Engineering Applications of Lasers MSc(Eng) (2012 - 2013), 2:1

Masters project - three months developing, constructing and testing a novel optical setup for characterising the strength of multiple holographic optical traps using a camera-based particle tracking method. Built an optical system to translate, modify and focus a laser beam using polarizers, waveplates, mirrors, lenses and a spatial light modulator. Collated, analysed and interpreted range of experimental data for project report and defence.


Chemistry Bsc (2009 - 2012), 2:1

Dissertation project:

Block copolymer and peptide synthesis and self-assembly, for potential use in drug delivery systems. Acquired competence in the planning, design and execution of experiments and developed an ability to work independently and be self-critical in the evaluation of risks, experimental procedures and outcomes
